<P><a href="https://highwiregames.com/golem/">Golem</a> is an ambitious project shipped as a Sony exclusive for the Playstation VR system by <a href="https://highwiregames.com/">Highwire Games.</a></P>

<p>I worked for Highwire for the final year of the product where I implemented the menu systems for the game.  I have always used Unity and C# so far in my career, so moving to Unreal was the first hurdle to overcome. It’s a great engine, and after getting used to the systems and patterns I think it might be my current favorite.</p>

<p>There were some challenges the largest of which was the fact the Unreal engine’s UI system does not work in stereoscopic rendering mode. It was decided to use a particle text system that allowed you to print text anywhere in the world. I would then produce the menu (as a list of text) about an arm’s distance away from the user. Tweaking the effect could produce “selected” state, etc.</p>
