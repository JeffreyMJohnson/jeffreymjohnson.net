#### Programmer / Designer - Jeffrey M Johnson

### Implementation
It is running on Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) using ASP .NET framework and the MVC design pattern.
Itâ€™s a pretty simple design so far, as I am still learning everything from scratch.  My first layout was an old fashioned static site of old with hard coded pages for each page! You can check out my original commits to see if you like.

I decided I would use the GitHub API and my own repository (repo) data to build a dynamic project list for the site to list.  Then I would use the readme from each repo for the detail page of each project. This would remove data and layout copying and was much more scalable for future.

### To-Do
More project detail work needs to be done and then would like to look at the view aspect of the design.
