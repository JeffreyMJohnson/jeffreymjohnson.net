    Welcome to my little piece of cyberspace. I'm a programmer living in the Seattle area of the beautiful
    Pacific Northwest USA. My education was focused on interactive graphical applications (games and such)
    and I love working on new challenges. I love to talk programming, gaming or pretty much any other geek
    subject, so <a href="mailto:jefjohms@gmail.com">send me an email</a>  if you like.
</p>

<p>
    Take a look around if you'd like to get to know me, and feel free to ping me, my info is on the @Html.ActionLink("Contact", "Contact", "Home") page.

<div class="alert alert-info">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-warning-sign"></span>
    This site is also a learning project for myself, so it will go through some changes as I explore the web programming domain...
