web site refactor with MVC principles.

Issue: using a asp.net mvc project and implementing a static html site, with separate actions and views pages that only differed in the data. No bueno.

the projects page lists porjects data and can link to each projects item page.  currently every time I wanted to add a new project I would need to copy an existing one and
then start changing the data to fit the new project. The layout would be the same, as you would expect because you usually like a consostent layout throughout the site.

Currently I have a seerate Action method for each project item view in the home controller. Each action would then load a view that is hardcoded to the project.  We can do better.
